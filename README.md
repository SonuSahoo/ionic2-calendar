That project support base calendar directive with Month, Week, Day views that can easy to integrate with your mobile app.

It's just for fun and expose a part my research on calendar processing with Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, iCalendar, etc.

Some of that library should be easy to apply but maybe hard to extends to adapt what you need. It's a message for user want developer extend that library and think about it does 80% work. 20% hardest things for your developer so should play nice :D 

## Calendar Month View 
- Grid base UI (not table)
- Expose date object directly for later use.

## Calendar Week View
- Will update soon

# Todo List
- Not directive or reusable component yet. (will update soon)
